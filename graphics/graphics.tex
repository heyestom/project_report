\chapter{Graphical Representations} 

After parsing the Blazon sentence into a parse tree the application attempts to draw a visual representation of the shield.  This is done via the use of HTML5's Canvas element and JavaScript.  

Producing the Graphical Depiction of the Blazon was less important from a  functionality standpoint than correct parsing of sentences but does make for a much more interesting application for an end user.
