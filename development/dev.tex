\chapter{Development}

The development of the application was performed using a test driven development model.  There were some initial prototypes which encompassed a small subset of the Blazon language and gave a textual description only were developed also. 


\section{Background Research}
The first couple of weeks of development time were spent exclusively on researching Blazon.  The the Blazon language provides a great number features  but is not particularly intuitive.  Two texts in particular were used \emph{ Heraldry, Its Origins and Meaning}\cite{bob} and \emph{The oxford guide to Heraldry}\cite{oxford}.  Both of the above provide a nice overview to heraldry with the former being very thorough on Blazon and the adoption of heraldry throughout Europe. 

Obviously with \emph{Luke Torjussen} having built a similar application\cite{luke} last year his system proved to be a very useful learning tool and later on  .
