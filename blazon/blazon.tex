\chapter{What is Blazon?}

Blazon is the language of heraldry and family crests, it dates back to the twelfth century and provides a strict set of rules about how to produce a coat of arms.  
There are several different versions of Blazon found around Europe however all follow the same behavioural rules regarding tinctures and charges.  Most versions differ only in the set of tinctures and honourable ordinaries either having a more generous or conservative view on what is and isn't acceptable for example, African Blazon allows for an Orange coloured Tincture whilst English Blazon does not.
For this project I focused on exclusively on a strict English Blazon.  


Blazon is a powerful language for allowing limitless combinations and configurations of patterns and shapes to be \emph{Blazoned} onto a shield in and recorded in a concise textual description.

What is impressive about the language is that it achieves this flexibility whilst reaming fairly formal and well defined, 
restricting the set of tinctures to total seven and maintaining a fairly low number of pre-defined honourable ordinaries. 

Blazon, like any other language, has some unique terminology used to address certain aspects of heraldry.  Anyone attempting utilize the language will need to familiarise themselves with this terminology.    

\section{The Seven Tinctures}
The most fundamental elements of Blazon are the Tinctures.  Tinctures are the set of colours allowed in coats of arms.  English Blazon defines a set of seven tinctures and places them into to groups metals and non-metals. 

\begin{table}[The Seven Tinctures]

	Purpure & Purple & Non-metal \\ 
	Sable & Black & Non-metal \\
	Vert & Green & Non-metal \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table of Tinctures found in English Blazon, the corresponding colours and whether each tincture is or isn't a metal.}
\label{tab:label}
\end{table}


Although at first this may seem overly restrictive Blazon overcomes having a limited set of valid tinctures by leaving interpretation of the tone and shade of each Tincture's corresponding colour to the artist producing the shield. 
An Azure, blue, shield could be a light sky blue or a dark navy shade of blue depending upon the artists preference, as long as it is recognisably blue. 

The Freedom of Interpretation is a great strength of Blazon vastly increases the different graphical variations of Blazoned shields without radically increasing the size of the language by exhaustively listing a set of valid tones and shades. 

With regard to the two metallic Tinctures Or, gold, and Argent, silver, having freedom of interpretation allows for matt, non-metallic, colours to be placed onto a shield, although they will still behave as metal Tinctures.  It is not uncommon to see yellow instead of gold and white instead of silver on many coats of arms.


\section{Furs}

Blazon incorporates several furs commonly used in coats of arms into the language.  These behave in much the same way as tinctures but don't have the same metal or non-metal property.

There are several pre-defined patterns for furs that are used directly instead of actual fur on a shield.  These patters generally consist of a repeating pattern on-top of a background colour.  Each fur has a unique pattern although several are very similar, some simply being the inverse of another.

The colours of Furs are pre-defined but can be explicitly stated as differing from the normal colours  by stating the Tinctures to be used instead.  For example for example Ermine coloured silver and black would be defined as \emph{"Ermine Argent and Sable"}

\section{Fields}
A Field is simply an area on a shield.  Initially a shield has one implicit Field, which is the entire area of that shield.  Blazon allows for two operations on fields, a field can be Tinctured, with a Tincture or a Fur, or a field can be Partitioned. 
Tincturing a Field dictates that the whole area incorporated in that Field be filled in the colour of that Tincture.  Partitioning I will cover in much more detail later on.


\section{How to Blazon a Coat of Arms: Part One}

I have now defined a large enough subset of Blazon for a couple of basic examples.  

In each example we are implicitly provided with a single Field which encompasses the entire body of the shield. Then we Tincture that Field by providing a Tincture and we have successfully Blazoned a shield.

\end{figure}

Although the examples in Figure 2.1 are very basic each is a complete instance of a valid Blazoning of a shield.

\section{Partitioning a Field}
The Blazon I have defined so far is very limited, only allowing for single Tincture shields.  The next natural area of the language to define is the operation of Partitioning a Field.  

As stated previously a Field can be either Tinctured or Partitioned.  To Partition a Field the key-word \emph{"Per"} is used. It is obligatory that the word immediately after \emph{"Per"} is a type of partition.  Blazon has several pre-defined partitions ranging from the very simple \emph{"Fess"} which divides a Field horizontally in half. 

Partitioning a Field divides it up into several smaller fields the number and shape of which depend on the type of Partition used.  After the Partition has been stated the Blazon sentence must go on to address the resulting new Fields. 

A shield is Implicitly Blazoned from top left to bottom right with the top most Field taking priority firstly and if two or more Fields are adjacent at the same height the left most takes priority.  

The Blazon sentence is only complete when all the Fields have been Tinctured.  If a Blazon sentence Partitions a shield into two Fields and then provides only one Tincture that sentence is Invalid.

\section{How to Blazon a Coat of Arms: Part Two}
Partitioning is a very powerful aspect of Blazon and increases the number of possible shield designs immensely.  A lot of very striking designs can be Blazoned onto a shield with very short Blazon sentences making use of Partitioning.  

The Blazon sentence,\emph{"Per Bend Gules and Azure"} Implicitly starts with a single Field which encompasses the entire body of the shield before partitioning that Field into two smaller Fields with the keyword \emph{"Per"} declaring a partition followed by the word \emph{"Bend"} which is a diagonal division of a field from top left to bottom right.  The Blazon goes onto Tincture the two new fields with the two Tinctures \emph{"Gules"} and \emph{"Azure"} respectively,  following Blazon's rule about evaluating the topmost and then leftmost field first the upper section of the shield is Tinctured \emph{"Gules"} and then the lower half is Tinctured \emph{"Azure"}.  There is no more Blazon reaming in the sentence and there are also no empty fields upon the shield, therefore this is a valid Blazon sentence and a striking red and blue shield has been produced.

Applying the same method as show above it is possible to validate the following Blazon sentences of similar complexity.

\end{figure}



\section{Sub-Partitioning}

The process of Partitioning a field produces two or more smaller Fields.  This allows for some very striking, though simple, designs.  Blazon allows however for fields to be Sub-Partitioned.  The new Fields produced after a Partitioning can themselves be Partitioned. 

Considerably more advanced patterns can be achieved buy using Sub-Partitioning.  The complexity is potentially infinite as there is no limit enforced by the language as to how many Partitions are allowed.  It is rare to see a historical shield Sub-Partitioned more than three times.  Sub-Partitioning makes use of exactly the same set of Partition types as regular Partitioning.  

Sub-Partitioning is expressed in exactly the same way as partitioning. Once the initial field has been partitioned instead of providing a Tincture for one of the new fields the keyword \emph{"Per"} is used to define a partition and then the type of partition is stated for example \emph{"Fess"}.  Then each of the new Fields need to be addressed either by being Tinctured or further partitioned. 

The new Fields created by the Partition fully evaluated before any other Fields on the shield are addressed.  The new sub-fields are addressed according to the same rules present in regular Partitioning, namely the top most Fields take Priority then the left most, once they have all been evaluated the next field according to partitioning rules is addressed.

\section{How to Blazon a Coat of Arms: Part Three}

With Sub-Partitioning the set of valid Blazon sentences ceases to be finite, it is possible to repeatedly Partition a Field then Sub-Partition the new Sub-Fields and endlessly repeating this process.  Very complex patterns can now be created with precisely defined Sub-Fields.

\emph{"Per Bend Per Pale Sable and Argent Per Fess Or and Gules"} is an example a Blazon sentence which makes use of Sub-Partitioning.  As before the the sentence is addressed from left to right and there is an implicit Field over the entire body of the shield.  The sentence is valid if there are as many Fields defined as there are instances of Tinctures in the sentence.

\section{Line Types}

Blazon allows for Partitions to be patterned with different Line Types.  The line division through a Field when partitioning is implicitly a straight line however there are a set of pre-defined Line Types which can be used instead.
