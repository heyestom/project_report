\chapter{Introduction}

My project was to \emph{Write a Grammar and Parser for Blazon}. Another student project by \emph{Luke Torjussen} done the year before my own had attempted, very successfully, to produce an application that both parsed and drew representations of Blazoned coats of arms.  This prior project used a parse generator to handle the grammar, lexing and parsing of the language.  It was my objective to see if performing the parsing by hand in my own application could realise a more complete representation of Blazon.

Initially then my project was entirely based in tokenising, lexing, parsing and validating Blazon sentences.  However my project grew later-on to also attempt to encompass producing a graphical representation of a parsed Blazon sentence as well as providing a plain English translation. 

\section{Aims}
The aim of my project was to produce an application which upon receiving a Blazon sentence would firstly validate the sentence according to the rules of the Blazon language and then produce an English translation.
