\section{Lexical Analysis} 

The first non-trivial step in Parsing is Lexical Analysis.  Lexical Analysis involves taking a series of words and classifying them into tokens.  A token can consist of an individual one of the given words or can be a group of them.  

With regard to Blazon the words to be Lexically analysed are a potential Blazon sentence and Tinctures, Partitions, and Charges need to be classified.  Fortunatly in Blazon this is a fairly simple task.  A Partition is always prefixed \emph{"Per"} then followed by one of a pre-defined set of known partitions then a tincture.  Charges are also always prefixed but with a \emph{Quantifier} and are always followed by a tincture
